# Phase 1: Project Setup & Upload

Build US-001, US-002 from `docs/PRD.md`.

Check git log and files to see what's already done. Build the next incomplete feature. Test with agent-browser. Commit if tests pass.

Skills: `convex/`, `file-upload/`, `ui-components/`
Design: `docs/design.md`

If you can't complete the acceptance criteria without human assistance, skip that part but make sure to report to user at the end of the loop on what still needs to be done.  When ALL acceptance criteria are met and tested:
<promise>PHASE 1 COMPLETE</promise>
