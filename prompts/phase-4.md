# Phase 4: Leaderboard & Analytics

Build US-007, US-008 from `docs/PRD.md`.

All UI in this phase is in the parent app (outside the iframe):
- Leaderboard between questions and final results
- Feedback overlay (correct/wrong + explanation)
- Per-question analytics and comprehension gaps
- Score calculation (server-side in Convex)

Check git log and files to see what's already done. Build the next incomplete feature. Test with agent-browser. Commit if tests pass.

Skills: `ui-components/`, `game-engine/`, `convex/`
Design: `docs/design.md`

If you can't complete the acceptance criteria without human assistance, skip that part but make sure to report to user at the end of the loop on what still needs to be done.  When ALL acceptance criteria are met and tested:
<promise>PHASE 4 COMPLETE</promise>
