# Phase 5: Polish & Demo Prep

Verify ALL user stories (US-001 through US-008) from `docs/PRD.md`.

Check git log and files to see what's already done. Fix bugs, handle edge cases, test end-to-end. Test with agent-browser. Commit if tests pass.

Skills: `convex/`, `game-engine/`, `ui-components/`
Design: `docs/design.md`

If you can't complete the acceptance criteria without human assistance, skip that part but make sure to report to user at the end of the loop on what still needs to be done.  When ALL acceptance criteria are met and tested:
<promise>PHASE 5 COMPLETE</promise>
