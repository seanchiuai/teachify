# Command: Refactor


You are a senior software engineer. Refactor the entire codebase for maintainability, consistency, and efficiency.

- Analyze and map the existing architecture, major dependencies, and modules.
- Identify code smells, outdated libraries, duplication, and inconsistent patterns.
- Propose a prioritized refactoring plan.
- After my approval, refactor module-by-module:
- Modernize code patterns (e.g., async/await, arrow functions).
- Remove dead code, merge similar utilities.
- Update all files with clear commit messages and explanations.
- Output all changes as diffs and highlight anything risky or needing follow-up tests
- Ensure all changes are committed before changing anything
